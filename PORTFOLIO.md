| **Description:** | A coding and UI exercise hitting the Official Joke API. Please see the project's [README](https://github.com/nshew13/jester/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#jester).                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **My Role:**     | all code written by me for a challenge prompt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Challenges:**  | One issue, [documented in the code](https://github.com/nshew13/jester/blob/1f6b68216bbdeed06a711659e990f30bfd64a639/src/components/JokeList.vue#L74-L92), popped up involving some break in reference/reactivity between the table and the individual jokes. In an ideal scenario, we'd be less limited by the API and would need less "in the middle" filtering. |
| **Outcome:**     | I'm happy with the outcome. Highlights of the project are included in its [README](https://github.com/nshew13/jester/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#implementation-highlights), as well as specific implementation notes, a roadmap and known issues.                                                                                                               |

| **Description:** | Card table simulator developed for use with tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) that use standard playing cards instead of dice.                                                                                 |
| **My Role:**     | all code written by me, originally to learn Vue 3 and Composition API                                                                                                                                             |
| **Challenges:**  | So far, this has been a pretty straightforward project. The ["Kanban board"/to-do list](https://github.com/nshew13/blackjack-rpg?tab=readme-ov-file#to-do) is available in the README, including some known bugs. |
| **Outcome:**     | This is one of those perpetual projects that may or may not see completion. If nothing else, it's a nice way to keep my skills sharp.                                                                             |

| **Description:** | Givers & Gamers was created as a way to raise funds for the local Ronald McDonald House Charity during the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of my friends works at RMHC and that's how I became involved as the project grew, creating website and [streaming resources for the event](https://www.giversandgamers.org/streamer-kit/). [giversandgamers.org](https://giversandgamers.org/) is still online, though the event has been discontinued.                                                                                                                  
| **My Role:**     | All code written by me, except for some animations, as noted in the [README](https://github.com/nshew13/givers-and-gamers?tab=readme-ov-file#attribution). I knew a reactive framework like Vue would be overkill, so I took the opportunity to learn and use Eleventy and Nunjucks, initially (see [`gng-2022` tech notes](https://github.com/nshew13/givers-and-gamers/blob/24704603b52ff8291a1a16dfe7b03dc9251d47bf/tech-notes.md)), which I later replaced with Astro.                                                                                                  |
| **Challenges:**  | On our initial funding platform (tagged as [`gng-2022`](https://github.com/nshew13/givers-and-gamers/tree/24704603b52ff8291a1a16dfe7b03dc9251d47bf)), I created a notification that would show on stream with each donor's name. Ultimately, that had to be disabled, because the API was not respecting (or was confusing) the ability for donors to remain anonymous, which I discovered during testing.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Outcome:**     | This project is more about presentation than technical skill. For the website, I gave some new design challenges to myself, including the fading diagonal background and SVG-clipped header. The *Golf With Your Friends Invitational* and Yahtzee leaderboards allowed other volunteers to input data in Google Sheets and have it display on the site and on-stream.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
